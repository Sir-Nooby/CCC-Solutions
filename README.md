This repository contains my solutions for Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition. It contains solutions from the year 2000-2024, and solutions are coded in Python and C++ (soon). I am always updating the solutions repository, so if a solution does not exist be patient!

All solutions are verified and AC'ed via DMOJ
